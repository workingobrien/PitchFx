An exercise in using the PitchFx data.

Question:
How does horizontal movement of a slider effect batting average? 

Step 1: Find the average horizontal movement and standard deviation of sliders.

select avg(abs(pfx_x)) avgHmove, stddev(abs(pfx_x)), pitch_type from pitches p
inner join
(
select * from atbats ab1
where ab1.p_throws = 'R'
)
as ab
on p.ab_guid = ab.ab_guid
group by p.pitch_type
order by avgHmove desc;

For this specific exercise, I am going to break it out by pitcher handedness. If you wanted to see the results for lefties you would use 'L'.

Step 2: Using the average horizontal movement and standard deviation create 20% buckets along the distrubtion. 

In 2014 the average slider thrown by a lefty had a average horizontal movment of 2.44 inches and the standard deviation was 2.08 inches. That means roughly 2/3 sliders thrown by a lefty moved between .36 inches and 4.52 inches. That is only slightly interesting, what is more interesting would be to see how a batter fared at 20% intervals. 

For lefties the buckets are:
Bucket%	HzMoveBottom 	HzMoveTop
0-19	>				0.72
20-39	0.72			1.92
40-59	1.92			2.96
60-79	2.96			4.16
80-100	4.16			<

For righties the buckets are:
Bucket%	HzMoveBottom	HzMoveTop
0-19	>				1.22
20-39	1.22			2.54
40-59	2.54			3.69
60-79	3.69			5
80-100	5				<

Step 3: Find the total hits on sliders. 

To find out the result of the at bat you need to look all the values in the "event" column on the at bat. I included 'Single','Double','Triple','Home Run'.

The first part of the query looks like:

select count(*) from atbats ab
inner join 
(
select max(p.event_num), p.* from pitches p
group by p.ab_guid order by p.event_num
) as InPlayPitches
on ab.ab_guid = InPlayPitches.ab_guid
inner join
(
select * from games where game_date < '2015-01-01'
)
as g
on ab.game_primarykey = g.game_primarykey
where ab.event in ('Single','Double','Triple','Home Run')
and InPlayPitches.pitch_type = 'SL';

The only wrinkle in this query is joining the last pitch of the at bat to the at bat specific at bat row. To achieve this I selected the max event_num value. I think this ensures I am only evaluating the last pitch of the at bat correctly. I did minor testing and it the numbers appeared to match. 

If you wanted to view the total hits for a lefty pitcher against a lefty hitter you would need to add the following: 
and ab.p_throws = 'L' and ab.stand = 'L'

If you wanted to view the total hits filtered by the corresponding 20% bucket (specifically 40-59 bucket for lefties):
and abs(InPlayPitches.pfx_x) > 1.9199 and abs(InPlayPitches.pfx_x) < 2.96;

The final query would look like:
select count(*) from atbats ab
inner join 
(
select max(p.event_num), p.* from pitches p
group by p.ab_guid order by p.event_num
) as InPlayPitches
on ab.ab_guid = InPlayPitches.ab_guid
inner join
(
select * from games where game_date < '2015-01-01'
)
as g
on ab.game_primarykey = g.game_primarykey
where ab.event in ('Single','Double','Triple','Home Run')
and InPlayPitches.pitch_type = 'SL'
and ab.p_throws = 'L' and ab.stand = 'L'
and abs(InPlayPitches.pfx_x) > 1.9199 and abs(InPlayPitches.pfx_x) < 2.96;

Step 4: Find the total at bats. 

According to fangraphs there were 165,614 at bats in 2014. When I calculate at bats I am short by 1,100. Additionally, I am short roughly 900 plate appearances when compared to fangraphs. The data is "slightly" off, but at least it is consistently off. 

The query I used to find at bats:

select count(*) from atbats ab
inner join 
(
select max(p.event_num), p.* from pitches p
group by p.ab_guid order by p.event_num
) as InPlayPitches
on ab.ab_guid = InPlayPitches.ab_guid
inner join
(
select * from games where game_date < '2015-01-01'
)
as g
on ab.game_primarykey = g.game_primarykey
where ab.event in ('Batter Interference',	'Bunt Groundout',	'Bunt Lineout',	'Bunt Pop Out',	'Double',	'Double Play',	
	 					'Fan interference',	'Field Error',	'Fielders Choice',	'Fielders Choice Out',	'Flyout',	'Forceout',
		 				'Grounded Into DP',	'Groundout', 'Home Run', 'Lineout',	'Pop Out',	'Single',	'Strikeout',
			 			'Strikeout - DP', 'Triple',	'Triple Play','Catcher Interference')
and InPlayPitches.pitch_type = 'SL'
and ab.p_throws = 'L' and ab.stand = 'L'
and abs(InPlayPitches.pfx_x) > 1.9199 and abs(InPlayPitches.pfx_x) < 2.96;

In conclusion:

Step 3's query returns: 116 hits
Step 4's query returns: 503 at bats

A left handed batter facing a lefty handed pitcher with a league average slider, defined as horizontal movement between 1.92 inches and 2.96 inches hit .231 in 2014. 

The full results are attached as an excel sheet. The biggest surprise in the results for me was that Lefty Pitcher / Righty  Hitter with almost no horizontal movement was hit 40 points higher then the corresponding Righty Pitcher / Lefty Hitter.
